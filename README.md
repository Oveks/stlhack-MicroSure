Project Title: Smart Contract-Based Micro-Insurance 
Project Description: This project aims to leverage blockchain technology to create a decentralized micro-
insurance platform. The platform will use smart contracts to automate the insurance process, reducing costs 
and increasing efficiency. 
Key Features: 
1. Smart Contracts: Implement smart contracts that define the rules and penalties related to the 
insurance agreement. The contract should automatically be executed when the agreed conditions are 
met. 
2. Micro-Insurance Products: Develop a range of micro-insurance products that cater to the specific 
needs of customers. For this project, we will only use flight delay insurance for both low and high-
income individuals, etc. 
3. Claim Verification: Integrate real-time data sources using APIs to verify claims. For instance, flight 
data for travel delay claims, etc. 
4. Premium Payment: Allow customers to pay premiums in small, frequent installments using digital 
payment methods. 
5. Transparency: Provide a transparent platform where customers can track their premium payments, 
claim status, and other details. 
Technology Stack: 
• Blockchain Platform: Ethereum 
• Smart Contract Language: Solidity (for Ethereum) 
• Frontend: React.js (Javascript)
